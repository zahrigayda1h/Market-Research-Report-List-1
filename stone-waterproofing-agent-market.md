<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Waterproofing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Stone Waterproofing Agent market is primarily divided into two types: solvent-based and water-based agents. Solvent-based agents use organic solvents as carriers, offering deep penetration and effective performance, ideal for dense stone surfaces. However, they may emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, water-based agents utilize water as a carrier, making them more environmentally friendly, easier to apply, and safer for indoor use. Both types aim to enhance stone durability and protect against water damage while varying in application methods and environmental impact.</p></p>
